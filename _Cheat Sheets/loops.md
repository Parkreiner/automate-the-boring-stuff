# Loops

## `for-range` loops

### `for i in range(a)`

The most basic form of loop. It starts from `0` and goes up to `a - 1`.

### `for i in range(a, b)`

This lets you set custom start and end points for the loop.

### `for i in range(a, b, c)`

This lets you set a custom start point (`a`), a custom end point (`b`), and a custom increment (`c`). This form also
allows you to set a value of `b` that's less than `a` â€“ so long as the increment `c` is negative.
