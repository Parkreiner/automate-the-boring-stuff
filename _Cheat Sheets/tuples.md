# Tuples

## Structure

Tuples are basically a specialized form of list. They are pieces of immutable data that represent an ordered set, but
they otherwise work like lists. Most list operations and techniques also work for tuples.

To make a tuple, just use `( )` instead of `[ ]`.

## Creating a tuple containing a single value

To create a one-element tuple, just use place a comma after the value you're placing in the parentheses.

```python
>>> (5,)
```
