# Keywords

## General

### `del`

The `del` keyword lets you delete a value. When used on an entire value, that value gets deleted. But when you use it on
something like a list index, `del` will delete the value at that index and bump all following values 1 to the left.

## Control flow

### `continue`

The `continue` keyword, when used inside a loop, stops the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
