# Project 1: Password Locker

This project basically involves creating a dumbed-down version of a password manager like LastPass. It seems that
this is how it'll basically work:

1. The user types the name of a website in as a command-line argument
2. If the website exists in the list of saved sites:
       2.1. The script copies that website's password into the user's clipboard
       2.2. The script prints a message saying that the password was successfully copied.

But as it turns out, this project was so simple that there was no need for making any kind of plan.
